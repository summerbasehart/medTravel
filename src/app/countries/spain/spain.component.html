  In Spain, the public healthcare system (Sistema Nacional de Salud - SNS) is virtually free at the point of use for residents and citizens. However, if you are not covered by the SNS and need medical care, you will be responsible for the full cost of treatment. Emergency room visits can cost around €200, while a doctor's appointment might be €40-50, according to Doctorsa.
